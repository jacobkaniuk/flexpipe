FlexPipe is an open source asset management system. It can be used for the management and tracking of assets in a VFX, animation and/or games pipeline, whether that is in a professional production environment, or for smaller personal projects at home.

FlexPipe's API is built with modularity and flexibility as it's key factor. The goal is to include different tools which could be used to help set up a structured workflow in an already existing environment, or tools specific to your production's needs can be easily created and incorporated using the extensible API.

For teams which are working collaboratively, with the majority of members working remotely, the system adds an easy way to get your project's pipeline set up in the cloud.

The system may also be an all around solution for smaller teams or studios looking to add a bit more structure and rigidness to their workflow and their content creation process.
